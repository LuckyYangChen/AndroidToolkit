# AndroidToolkit
===================================

- This is a tool that can help Android development engineers and test engineers view network interface logs more conveniently. 
- You can view the status, address and time of the network interface request in the list. 
- In the detail page, because the json has been colored, the entire data looks more intuitive. 
- Of course, you can also share the data to the people you want to share through other apps

## step 1 : update root project build.gradle
```groovy
buildscript {
    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
    }
}
```

## step 2 : update module's build.gradle
```groovy
dependencies {
    implementation 'io.github.weilianyang:toolkit:1.0.0'
}
```


## step 3 : init the toolkit
* I suggest you do initialization in the onCreate method of the Application as early as possible
```kotlin
class App : Application() {

    override fun onCreate() {
        super.onCreate()
        // set config data
        val config = ToolkitConfig.Builder().setDebugMode(BuildConfig.DEBUG).build()
        // init toolkit
        ToolkitPanel.init(this, config)
    }
}
```


## step 4 : display the toolkit entrance
```kotlin
    // Request the permission of the floating window and display the toolkit entrance
    // The logic of applying for permissions and callbacks 
    // has been automatically processed inside the method
    ToolkitPanel.showFloating(this)
```

## step 5 : capture network interface logs
 * If you are using Okhttp, then you only need to add [ApiRecordInterceptor](https://github.com/WeiLianYang/AndroidToolkit/tree/main/toolkit/src/main/java/com/william/toolkit/net/ApiRecordInterceptor) to automatically capture network interface logs.
```kotlin
fun getOkHttpClient(): OkHttpClient {
    val builder = OkHttpClient().newBuilder()
   
    builder.run {

        // Add the interceptor defined in the package
        addInterceptor(ApiRecordInterceptor())

        connectTimeout(TIMEOUT, TimeUnit.SECONDS)
        readTimeout(TIMEOUT, TimeUnit.SECONDS)
        writeTimeout(TIMEOUT, TimeUnit.SECONDS)
    }
    return builder.build()
}
```

* If you donâ€™t want to use the interceptor, also you can use the method provided in the library to manually save the data, and it will work normally, just like this
```kotlin
fun saveRecord() {
    val bean = ApiRecordBean(
        url = "https://developer.android.com/",
        method = "POST",
        headers = "{\"os\":\"android\", \"language\":\"en\"}",
        request = "{\"param1\": \"first param\",\"param2\": \"second param\"}",
        response = "{\"code\": code, \"success\": true, \"msg\": \"execute msg\"}",
        requestTime = System.currentTimeMillis(),
        duration = 100,
        httpCode = 200
    )
    DataManager.saveRecord(bean)
}
```

## Reporting Issues
